Buckminster Fuller was a renowned 20th century inventor and visionary born in Milton, Massachusetts on July 12, 1895.</p><p>Dedicating his life to making the world work for all of humanity, Fuller operated as a practical philosopher who demonstrated his ideas as inventions that he called “artifacts.” Fuller did not limit himself to one field but worked as a 'comprehensive anticipatory design scientist' to solve global problems surrounding housing, shelter, transportation, education, energy, ecological destruction, and poverty.</p><p>Throughout the course of his life Fuller held 28 patents, authored 28 books, received 47 honorary degrees. And while his most well know artifact, the geodesic dome, has been produced over 300,000 times worldwide, Fuller's true impact on the world today can be found in his continued influence upon generations of designers, architects, scientists and artists working to create a more sustainable planet.</p>"

The bulk of her musical production and atmospheric sound for television and radio programmes is on tape in the BBC Sound Archives.</p><p>After her death, 267 tapes from her attic as well as a box of her papers were consigned to the archive, then in 2007 donated to Manchester University Center for Screen Studies who have digitized them but only three new tracks have been released since then, on compilation albums with music from other composers. Most will probably never be heard again. Mark Ayres made a catalogue of the BBC archives and of the attic tapes but neither has been published.</p>"

In his later works Dick's thematic focus strongly reflected his personal interest in metaphysics and theology. He often drew upon his own life experiences in addressing the nature of drug abuse, paranoia, schizophrenia, and transcendental experiences in novels such as A Scanner Darkly and VALIS. He also wrote extensively on philosophy, theology, the nature of reality and science later in his life that was published posthumously as The Exegesis.</p><p>In addition to 44 published novels, Dick wrote approximately 121 short stories, most of which appeared in science fiction magazines during his lifetime.</p><p>In 2005, Time magazine named Ubik one of the hundred greatest English-language novels published since 1923. In 2007, Dick became the first science fiction writer to be included in The Library of America series.</p>"

His work for international clients continues to this day. Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, Syd Mead, Inc. provided architectural renderings both interior and exterior.</p><p>Syd continues to be involved in a variety of design projects. In May 2007 he completed work on a documentary of his career with director Joaquin Montalvan, called “Visual Futurist.” Mead attributes success in a range of creative activities to the premise that imagination—the idea—supersedes technique.</p>"
