Buckminster Fuller was a renowned 20th century inventor and visionary born in Milton, Massachusetts on July 12, 1895.</p><p>Dedicating his life to making the world work for all of humanity, Fuller operated as a practical philosopher who demonstrated his ideas as inventions that he called “artifacts.” Fuller did not limit himself to one field but worked as a 'comprehensive anticipatory design scientist' to solve global problems surrounding housing, shelter, transportation, education, energy, ecological destruction, and poverty.</p><p>Throughout the course of his life Fuller held 28 patents, authored 28 books, received 47 honorary degrees. And while his most well know artifact, the geodesic dome, has been produced over 300,000 times worldwide, Fuller's true impact on the world today can be found in his continued influence upon generations of designers, architects, scientists and artists working to create a more sustainable planet.</p></div></div></article><article class="tout profile num-2 of-4 col-sm-3 even"><div class="tout-container"><img class="img-circle center-block" src="/images/profile-delia-derbyshire.jpg" alt="image"><h3 class="title">Delia Derbyshire</h3><h4 class="subtitle">Musician &amp; Composer</h4><div class="description"><p>Delia Derbyshire is one of the earliest and most influential electronic sound synthesists. She was musically active from 1962 until the mid seventies, then briefly again for a few years before she died in 2001 at the age of 64.</p><p>Although her revolutionary sounds are familiar to over a hundred million people through the theme to the television series "Doctor Who" and the seminal album of 1969 "An Electric Storm" she was hardly ever credited and her name is almost unknown. The bulk of her musical production and atmospheric sound for television and radio programmes is on tape in the BBC Sound Archives.</p><p>After her death, 267 tapes from her attic as well as a box of her papers were consigned to the archive, then in 2007 donated to Manchester University Center for Screen Studies who have digitized them but only three new tracks have been released since then, on compilation albums with music from other composers. Most will probably never be heard again. Mark Ayres made a catalogue of the BBC archives and of the attic tapes but neither has been published.</p></div></div></article><article class="tout profile num-3 of-4 col-sm-3 odd"><div class="tout-container"><img class="img-circle center-block" src="/images/profile-philip-k-dick.jpg" alt="image"><h3 class="title">Philip K. Dick</h3><h4 class="subtitle">Writer &amp; Philosopher</h4><div class="description"><p>Philip K. Dick explored sociological, political and metaphysical themes in novels dominated by monopolistic corporations, authoritarian governments, and altered states. In his later works Dick's thematic focus strongly reflected his personal interest in metaphysics and theology. He often drew upon his own life experiences in addressing the nature of drug abuse, paranoia, schizophrenia, and transcendental experiences in novels such as A Scanner Darkly and VALIS. He also wrote extensively on philosophy, theology, the nature of reality and science later in his life that was published posthumously as The Exegesis.</p><p>In addition to 44 published novels, Dick wrote approximately 121 short stories, most of which appeared in science fiction magazines during his lifetime.</p><p>In 2005, Time magazine named Ubik one of the hundred greatest English-language novels published since 1923. In 2007, Dick became the first science fiction writer to be included in The Library of America series.</p></div></div></article><article class="tout profile num-4 of-4 col-sm-3 even last"><div class="tout-container"><img class="img-circle center-block" src="/images/profile-syd-mead.jpg" alt="image"><h3 class="title">Syd Mead</h3><h4 class="subtitle">Artist &amp; Futurist</h4><div class="description"><p>Syd Mead (born July 18, 1933), is a "visual futurist" and a neofuturistic concept artist.
